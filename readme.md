## Project Overview

This portfolio website aims to showcase your projects and skills in an interactive and immersive 3D environment. It utilizes cutting-edge web technologies to provide a smooth and engaging user experience.

## Technologies Used

*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **Three.js:** A JavaScript 3D library.
*   **@react-three/fiber:** A React renderer for Three.js.
*   **@react-three/drei:**  A collection of useful helpers and abstractions for @react-three/fiber.
*   **Framer Motion:** A production-ready motion library for React.
*   **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):**  A JavaScript library for robust, high-performance animations.
*   **Lucide React:**  A collection of beautiful and consistent icons.
*   **React Intersection Observer:**  A React component for observing when an element enters or leaves the viewport.
*   **Vite:** A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
*   **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
*   **ESLint:** A JavaScript linting tool to enforce code style and prevent errors.

## Scripts

The following scripts are defined in the `package.json` file:

*   `dev`: Starts the development server using Vite.
*   `build`: Builds the production-ready application using Vite.
*   `lint`: Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues.
*   `preview`: Starts a local server to preview the built application.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd [project directory]
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install or pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev  # or yarn dev or pnpm dev
    ```

    This will start the development server and open the application in your browser.  You can usually find it running at `http://localhost:5173/`.

## Directory Structure
